><Background
>Judge Joe Dredd is the Law. He’s a big muscular man, with a large pugnacious jaw, and a habitual scowl; which is the source of his nick-name among the younger judges: “Old Stony Face”. He is never seen out of uniform, or even without his helmet. The uniform is based on a black skin-tight body-suit, of a leather-like synthetic material. Boots, knee-pads and gloves are olive green, and thickly reinforced. At the left shoulder is a large pad, balanced on the right by a stylized eagle. A badge on the left breast bears his name, “Dredd”. A chain hangs in a loop from the badge. A belt, with eagle buckle, carries ammunition, hand-cuffs, etc. Shoulder-pad, eagle, badge, chain and belt are all colored gold, as are his elbow-pads. The helmet is black, with red trim and a darkened visor.</Background
><Strengths
>Helmet MK II: The helmet is made from bonded Kevlar and Plastisteel. Standard Street Judge head gear incorporates a Respirator, Anti-glare Visor and Radio Microphone. Provides Excellent protection vs Physical attacks. Contains sealed systems Respirator gas mask EX (20 minutes of oxygen) , communications radio RM. Armour: The distinctive shoulder, elbow and knee pads of the uniform, along with a Judge’s badge, are advanced armour components, designed to act as symbols of office but also to provide much needed protection. Made from a mixture of Plasteen and foamed Kevlar, the armour components are light, do not inhibit movement and offer optimum protection without burdening the judge. Provides Excellent protection vs Physical Attacks and Good vs Energy Attacks. Gloves and Boots: Reinforced to allow +1CS to blunt damage attacks for slugfest. Body Suit Uniform: Plasteen-Kevlar fabric; Good vs physical and energy. Lawgiver MK II (Gun): Standard issue to all Mega City One Judges. Self Destructive Charge: The Law Giver MK II is DNA coded so that if it detects an unfamiliar handprint from the highly sensitive ultrasonic palm scanner set in the pistol grip (on either side, to allow left or right-handed firing) scans the user’s hand print every time the Lawgiver is fired, the scanner is powerful enough to penetrate any standard glove. If the scanned hand print does not match that of the owning judge, or is unreadable, the Lawgiver on board computer will automatically detonate the high explosive charge also set within the grip when the trigger is pulled: Remarkable damage (possible Kill).</Strengths

>Mega-City One, where crime runs riot. This urban sprawl is home to 400 million citizens, everyone a potential criminal. The city is spread down the Eastern coast of what was once the United States of America. Unemployment is endemic, boredom is universal and only the Judges can prevent total anarchy. As Judge, jury and executioner, Joe Dredd is empowered to dispense instant justice. When it comes to crushing crime, Judge Dredd invented zero tolerance. Joseph Dredd and his brother, Rico, were cloned from the bloodline of Judge Fargo in 2066. They both grew up in the Academy of Law and soon proved to be two of the finest cadet Judges in Mega-City One history. Nevertheless, Joe was always marginally behind his brother when it came to skill and achievement throughout their training, although Rico's extra flair came with a fatal flaw in his personality. After their graduation with honors in 2079 Joe found out about some illegal sidelines that Rico had set-up for himself. Joe was forced to arrest his own brother and have him sent to Titan, and it was only then that the Justice Department realised what a special Judge they had in Dredd. Dredd soon achieved the status of Senior Judge and rapidly became not only the most feared and respected Judge in Mega-City One, but also a powerful figurehead for justice in the wild and dangerous world of the 22nd century.</Weaknesses
