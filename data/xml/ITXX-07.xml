><Background
>Darkwing Duck (real name Drake Mallard) is the titular protagonist of the 1991-1992 cartoon series of the same name and tries to protect his city from a number of villains. He is a parody of awesome heroes such as Batman, Green Hornet and The Shadow, but unlike the former Darkwing Duck, he has a strong desire for fame and attention, a desire he often has to combat in order to stay heroic. His adopted daughter named Gosalyn Mallard, his sidekicks, Launchpad McQuack, and sometimes, Honker Muddlefoot, and his girlfriend, Morgana, help him in many adventures. Darkwing Duck begins to learn what being a true hero is all about.</Background
><Strengths
>Launchpad is Darkwing's best friend and sidekick. When they first met, Launchpad revealed that he is his biggest fan and he offered him to be his sidekick, they were chasing Taurus Bulba's henchmen but they failed and Darkwing refused Launchpad's offer. However, after Launchpad saved Darkwing from prison, Darkwing acceted him as his sidekick and now he is helping him with his chores and crime fighting. In "Water Way to Go" Darkwing made Launchpad his partner (but it's not official since Launchpad keeps referring to himself as Darkwing's sidekick). In "A Duck by Any Other Name" Darkwing is upset and jelaous that St. Canard thinks that Launchpad is Darkwing, however Launchpad is trying to prove them that they are wrong. Darkwing doesn't likes Launchpad's stupidity but he likes his potential.</Strengths
><Weaknesses
>Megavolt is Darkwing's archenemy, they have a strong enemyship. In "Clash Reunion" he is the first supervillain Darkwing ever faced, Darkwing/Drake is shocked when he finds out that Megavolt was his classmate Elmo Sputterspark. Despite their differences, Megavolt has been teaming up with Darkwing in the episodes: "Twitching Channels", "Stressed to Kill", "Jail Bird", "Negaduck" and "The Frequency Fiends", but only in "Stressed to Kill" and "The Frequency Fiends" Megavolt didn't tricked Darkwing Duck. In "The Frequency Fiends", Darkwing told Megavolt that he is his archenemy which made Megavolt flattered. Negaduck is Darkwing Duck's arch-nemesis, evil doppelgänger and evil counterpart. They have strong enemyship since Negaduck is a Darkwing Duck from alternate universe, however Darkwing is always able to spoil Negaduck's plans. Darkwing hates when Negaduck frames him by disguising as Darkwing Duck. His enemyship with Negaduck is the same as Megavolt's.</Weaknesses
