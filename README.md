# Backend Design

## Overview
This repository contains an example of a simple backend web application using JavaScript and Node.js.

It is a student project within the university course **"Backend Development" (5 ECTS)** offered by Åland University of Applied Sciences.

The purpose is to teach first-year university students how to design and implement a backend web application in Node.js. This backend is built around the frontend developed in the previous course, **"Frontend Development" (5 ECTS)**, making this course a natural continuation of earlier work.

This project stores data in an MS Access database. At the time this course is conducted, students have not yet gained deeper knowledge of relational database design. The students work in a Windows environment, and the finished application is deployed on an IIS web server at the end of the course.

For instructional purposes, the project uses the MD5 hashing algorithm for passwords. This intentionally weak algorithm is used to demonstrate security vulnerabilities and to provide practical understanding of why stronger algorithms such as bcrypt or Argon2 are recommended.
